# Project 1: Amazon web scrapping
For fetching the data of product, from amazon website is created web scrapper. For that i used BeautifulSoup and selenium modules. 
Using this scrapper we can fetch data of books and any avalibale products from amazon. I used this scrapper for fetching data of books avalibale of amazon site. There might be
many books on it, but i fetch only from 1 to 20 pages of data. On one page it contain 48 books data. 
Data about books such as a Name of Book, Author of Book, Price, Rating and URL is staored on csv file. That data can be further use for analyasis purpose.
